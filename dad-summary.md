# PaintPros.io Business Summary

**Prepared for Investment Consideration**  
**December 2024**

---

## What This Is

PaintPros.io is a software platform built specifically for painting contractors and home service businesses. It replaces multiple expensive tools they currently pay for separately - websites, scheduling software, customer databases, estimating tools - with one integrated system.

The key differentiator: **AI-powered room scanning**. A contractor takes a photo of a room, and the software calculates square footage, generates professional estimates, and creates customer proposals automatically. No one else in this market has this.

---

## The Market

**U.S. Painting Industry Size:** $52 billion annually (IBISWorld, 2024)

**Number of Painting Contractors in the U.S.:** ~290,000 businesses

**Current Software Landscape:**
- Most painting contractors use 3-5 separate tools (website hosting, scheduling, invoicing, CRM, estimating)
- Average monthly software spend for a mid-size contractor: $500-1,500/month across multiple platforms
- The dominant players (ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro) are generic - not built for painters specifically

**The Gap:** No one has built a complete, trade-specific platform with AI estimating for painters. PaintPros.io fills that gap.

---

## What's Already Built

This is not a concept or a prototype. The platform is functional and has a live beta customer.

**Core Features (Operational):**
- AI Room Scanner - photograph a room, get instant square footage calculations
- Professional proposal generation with Good/Better/Best pricing packages
- Customer booking and scheduling system
- Crew management and internal messaging
- Customer relationship management (CRM)
- Digital document signing
- Blockchain verification for contracts and estimates (tamper-proof records)
- Automated marketing posting to social media

**Beta Customer:** Nashville Painting Professionals (NPP) - actively using the platform

## Revenue Model

**Subscription-Based SaaS (Software as a Service)**

Customers pay monthly for access. No physical inventory, no shipping, no per-transaction costs on our end.

### Founder's Club Pricing (First 100 Customers)

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Target Customer |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Starter | $199 | $1,990 | Solo painters, 1-2 person operations |
| Professional | $499 | $4,990 | Growing companies, 3-5 employees |
| Business | $799 | $7,990 | Established contractors, 10-15 employees |
| Enterprise | $1,499 | $14,990 | Large operations, franchises |

### Standard Pricing (After First 100)

| Tier | Monthly | Annual |
|------|---------|--------|
| Starter | $399 | $3,990 |
| Professional | $799 | $7,990 |
| Business | $1,299 | $12,990 |
| Enterprise | $2,499 | $24,990 |

**Why These Prices Are Reasonable:**

For context, a painting company doing $1M/year in revenue currently pays:
- Website: $200-500/month (often much more for custom sites)
- Scheduling software (Jobber): $169-349/month
- CRM software: $50-200/month
- Estimating tools: $50-150/month
- **Total: $469-1,199/month for fragmented, non-integrated tools**

Our $499-799/month replaces all of that with a better, integrated solution.

Real example: A competitor in the Nashville market pays $3,300/month for just their website - no tools, no AI, no automation. They would save money switching to our Enterprise tier at $1,499/month while getting 10x the functionality.

## Revenue Projections

**Conservative Scenario (Year 1-2):**

| Milestone | Customers | Avg Revenue/Month | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 6 months | 25 | $500 | $12,500 | $150,000 |
| 12 months | 75 | $550 | $41,250 | $495,000 |
| 18 months | 150 | $600 | $90,000 | $1,080,000 |
| 24 months | 250 | $650 | $162,500 | $1,950,000 |

**Assumptions:**
- Blended average of different tier subscriptions
- 5% monthly churn (industry average for B2B SaaS)
- No one-time setup fees included (those would add to revenue)

**Path to $1M ARR:** Approximately 150-175 customers at blended average pricing.

This is achievable. There are 290,000 painting contractors in the U.S. We need 0.05% market penetration to hit $1M ARR.

## Competitive Analysis

| Feature | PaintPros.io | Jobber | ServiceTitan | Housecall Pro |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| AI Room Scanning | Yes | No | No | No |
| Painting-Specific | Yes | No (generic) | No (generic) | No (generic) |
| Proposal Generation | Yes | Basic | Yes | Basic |
| Crew Management | Yes | Limited | Yes | Limited |
| Starting Price | $199/mo | $39/mo | ~$250/tech | $49/mo |
| Full-Suite Price | $799/mo | $599/mo | $3,000-15,000/mo | ~$300/mo |

**Key Advantage:** We're the only platform built specifically for painters with AI estimation. The generic platforms can't match the accuracy or speed of trade-specific tools.

---

## Growth Strategy

**Phase 1: Prove the Model (Current)**
- One paying beta customer (NPP)
- Refine the platform based on real usage
- Document case study and results

**Phase 2: Self-Service Launch (Q1 2025)**
- Enable contractors to sign up and onboard themselves
- Automated billing through Stripe
- Founder's Club marketing push (urgency: limited spots)

**Phase 3: Paid Marketing & Referrals (Q2 2025)**
- Targeted Facebook/Google ads to painting contractors
- Affiliate program for industry influencers
- Referral bonuses for existing customers

**Phase 4: Trade Vertical Expansion (Q3-Q4 2025)**
- Adapt platform for Roofing (RoofPros.io)
- Adapt platform for HVAC (HVACPros.io)
- Same platform, different trade configurations
- Each vertical represents another $50B+ market

## What The Investment Would Fund

**Requested Amount:** $25,000 - $50,000

**Allocation:**

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Domain & Hosting | $2,000 | Custom domains (paintpros.io, roofpros.io, etc.) |
| Marketing | $15,000-30,000 | Paid ads, content creation, trade show presence |
| Legal/Business | $3,000 | LLC formation, contracts, terms of service |
| Infrastructure | $5,000-10,000 | Server scaling, backup systems, security audits |
| Operating Reserve | $5,000 | 3-month runway buffer |

**Return Expectation:**

At 150 customers ($1M ARR), the company would be valued at approximately $3-5M using standard SaaS valuation multiples (3-5x ARR for early-stage).

A $50,000 investment at current stage could represent 5-10% equity, valued at $150,000-500,000 at the $1M ARR milestone.

## Risks (Honest Assessment)

**1. Customer Acquisition Cost**
- Reaching contractors requires targeted marketing
- Mitigation: Self-service model reduces sales cost; referral program leverages word-of-mouth

**2. Competition from Established Players**
- Jobber and ServiceTitan have more resources
- Mitigation: They're generic; we're specialized. Trade-specific beats one-size-fits-all.

**3. Technical Complexity**
- AI features require ongoing refinement
- Mitigation: Core technology is already built and working. Improvements are iterative.

**4. Market Adoption**
- Contractors can be slow to adopt new technology
- Mitigation: AI estimator saves real time and money - demonstrable ROI within first month of use.

---

## Why Now

1. **The Platform is Built** - This isn't a pitch for something theoretical. The software works. A customer is using it.

2. **AI Timing** - AI tools are becoming expected, not optional. Contractors who don't adopt will fall behind.

3. **Remote Work Shift** - COVID accelerated digital adoption in trades. Contractors now expect software solutions.

4. **Founder's Club Window** - Early customers lock in lower pricing forever. Creates urgency and rewards early adopters.

---

## Summary

PaintPros.io is a functional SaaS platform serving a $52 billion industry with 290,000 potential customers. The technology works, a beta customer is actively using it, and the revenue model is straightforward subscription pricing.

The ask is modest ($25,000-50,000) for meaningful equity in a business with clear path to $1M+ ARR through 150-200 customers - a fraction of a percent of the addressable market.

The risk is real but manageable. The opportunity is significant and time-sensitive.
