# Online Booking System - Admin Guide

## How It Works

Nashville Painting Professionals now has an online booking system that allows customers to request appointments directly from the website.

### Customer Experience

1. Customers visit **nashpaintpros.io/book** (also accessible via "Book Online" in the navigation menu)
2. They complete a simple 5-step wizard:
   - **Step 1:** Select service type (Interior, Exterior, Commercial, or Residential)
   - **Step 2:** Choose their preferred date
   - **Step 3:** Select an available time slot
   - **Step 4:** Enter their contact information (name, email, phone, address)
   - **Step 5:** Review and submit their booking request

### What Happens When Someone Books

1. The booking is created with **PENDING** status (not confirmed)
2. An email notification is sent to **service@nashvillepaintingprofessionals.com**
3. The booking appears in your Admin Dashboard under "Upcoming Bookings"

### Your Role as Admin

**You must review and approve every booking request.** This prevents scheduling conflicts.

To manage bookings:
1. Log into the Admin Dashboard using your PIN
2. Look for the "Upcoming Bookings" section
3. For each pending booking, you can:
   - **Confirm** - Approve the appointment (green checkmark)
   - **Cancel** - Decline with a reason (red X)
   - **Mark Complete** - After the job is done
   - **No Show** - If customer doesn't show up

### Email Notifications

All booking requests are sent to: **service@nashvillepaintingprofessionals.com**

Each email includes:
- Customer name and contact info
- Requested service type
- Preferred date and time
- Any notes from the customer
- A reminder to log in and confirm/decline

### Why This System Benefits You

- **No double-bookings:** You control the schedule by approving requests
- **Capture leads 24/7:** Customers can book anytime, not just during business hours
- **Organized records:** All bookings are tracked in one place
- **Email backup:** You get notified immediately when someone wants to book

## A Note About the Backend System

The NPP booking system is the same platform that powers Lume Paint Co. In the future, you may find it easier to manage both businesses from a single dashboard with separate tabs for each company. This would allow you to:

- See all appointments across both companies in one view
- Switch between NPP and Lume with a simple tab click
- Use the same login credentials for both
- Get a unified view of your entire operation

This unified approach is something we can set up whenever you're ready. It would make managing multiple brands much simpler since the backend is already shared.
