# Darkwave Chain Integration Request

**Project:** PaintPros.io / Nashville Painting Professionals (NPP)  
**Date:** December 21, 2025  
**Requested By:** Orbit Development Team  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Current State

PaintPros.io currently hashes release versions and document hallmarks to **Solana Mainnet** for blockchain verification. We need to add **dual-chain support** to also stamp to Darkwave Chain.

### Existing Blockchain Implementation
- **Network:** Solana Mainnet-Beta
- **Method:** Memo transactions with SHA-256 content hashes
- **Library:** `@solana/web3.js`
- **Storage:** Release records store `solanaTxSignature` and `solanaTxStatus`

### What We're Hashing
1. **Release Versions** - Content hashes for each software release
2. **Hallmarks** - Unique identifiers for documents, contracts, estimates
3. **Document Signatures** - PDF signature verification hashes

---

## Information Needed for Darkwave Chain Integration

### 1. Network Configuration
- [ ] **RPC Endpoint URL** - Primary network endpoint (e.g., `https://rpc.darkwave.io`)
- [ ] **Chain ID** - Network identifier
- [ ] **Network Type** - Mainnet, Testnet, or both?
- [ ] **Block Explorer URL** - For generating verification links

### 2. Authentication & Keys
- [ ] **Private Key Format** - How should wallet keys be formatted?
- [ ] **Key Generation** - Do we need to create a new wallet or is one provided?
- [ ] **API Key Required?** - If RPC requires authentication

### 3. Technical Details
- [ ] **EVM Compatible?** - Can we use ethers.js/web3.js?
- [ ] **Custom SDK?** - Is there a Darkwave-specific library?
- [ ] **Transaction Format** - How do we submit data/memos?
- [ ] **Gas/Fee Token** - What's the native token for fees?
- [ ] **Confirmation Time** - Expected block confirmation time

### 4. Data Storage Schema
- [ ] **Max Data Size** - Limit for memo/data field per transaction
- [ ] **Recommended Format** - JSON, hex-encoded hash, etc.

## Proposed Implementation

### Database Schema Addition
```typescript
// Add to releases table
darkwaveTxSignature: varchar("darkwave_tx_signature"),
darkwaveTxStatus: varchar("darkwave_tx_status"),

// Add to hallmarks table  
darkwaveTxSignature: varchar("darkwave_tx_signature"),
darkwaveExplorerUrl: varchar("darkwave_explorer_url"),
```

### New Environment Variables Needed
```
DARKWAVE_RPC_URL=
DARKWAVE_CHAIN_ID=
DARKWAVE_PRIVATE_KEY=
DARKWAVE_EXPLORER_BASE_URL=
```

### Code Structure
```
server/
├── solana.ts          # Existing Solana integration
├── darkwave.ts        # NEW: Darkwave Chain client
└── blockchain.ts      # NEW: Unified multi-chain interface
```

## Agent Handoff Notes

### For Future Development Agents

**Context:** The client (Orbit/Darkwave Studios) has launched their own Layer 1 blockchain called "Darkwave Chain" and wants PaintPros.io to hash releases to both Solana AND Darkwave Chain.

**Current Status:**
- Solana integration is complete and working
- NPP v1.1.10 Build 15 was just stamped to Solana
- Database schema ready for dual-chain fields
- Need Darkwave Chain connection details from their dev team

**Files to Modify:**
1. `server/darkwave.ts` - Create new blockchain client (similar to solana.ts)
2. `shared/schema.ts` - Add darkwave fields to releases/hallmarks tables
3. `server/routes.ts` - Update /api/releases/stamp to call both chains
4. `server/index.ts` - Update autoDeployVersionBump() for dual-chain

**Testing Approach:**
1. Get testnet credentials first
2. Verify single transaction works
3. Implement dual-chain stamping
4. Add UI indicators for Darkwave verification
