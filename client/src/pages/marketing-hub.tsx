Below I'll walk you through what's ready, how to use it, what I'm still connecting, and where we're headed. Let's make this thing dominate.`,
        section1: `Section 1: What's Ready Right Now. We have over 100 marketing images loaded and organized, a visual content catalog where you can browse everything, a scheduling calendar to plan your posts, real-time analytics tracking with charts and metrics, and a Team Notes feature so we can leave messages for each other.`,
        section2: `Section 2: How To Operate It. Your Tasks. The system is built and ready to go. Now I need your help running it. These are your responsibilities to keep the marketing machine operating at maximum effectiveness. First, Review AI Captions: When the AI generates content, review it before it goes live. Does it sound like NPP? Your approval ensures brand voice stays consistent. Second, Spot Trends: You're on social media daily. When you see trending formats or ideas that could work for a painting company, flag them. This keeps our content fresh and relevant. Third, Monitor Engagement: Check the Analytics tab weekly. Note which posts are winning and which are underperforming. This data drives our optimization decisions. Fourth, Curate the Library: Browse the Content Catalog regularly. Flag outdated images, suggest new pairings, and keep the library fresh. Quality in equals quality out.`,

Step 2, Meta API Connection, is in progress. Working on getting the direct API connection to Meta set up. Step 3, Full Automation, is coming next.`,
        section4: `Section 4: Where We're Headed. The Marketing AI will handle Content Suggestions, Smart Scheduling, Performance Alerts, and Ad Optimization automatically.`,
        section5: `Section 5: How We Stay In Sync. Use the Team Notes tab to leave messages. For example, you post: "Hey, updated next week's Nextdoor post." I reply: "Got it, scheduled for next week." Everyone sees the notes and stays in the loop. The goal is efficiency. The system runs like a carousel, it never stops.`,

                      Analytics help you understand what's working and what needs attention. 
                      <strong> Evergreen content</strong> can be reused year-round (like "5 tips for choosing paint colors").
                      <strong> Seasonal content</strong> is timely (like "Spring painting specials"). 
                      A healthy mix is 70% evergreen, 30% seasonal.
