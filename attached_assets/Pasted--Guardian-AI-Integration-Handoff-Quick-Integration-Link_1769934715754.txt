What Is Guardian AI?
Guardian AI is the world's first certification system for autonomous AI agents in crypto. As millions of AI bots flood the market (21,000+ tokens launched in November 2024 alone), users have NO way to verify which agents are safe. Guardian AI solves this trust crisis.

The Problem We're Solving
1 million+ AI agents projected on-chain by end of 2025
$50+ billion AI crypto market cap
Zero industry-wide certification standards
Users can't tell safe agents from scams
AI agents can drain wallets, manipulate trades, steal funds
What Guardian AI Does

Submit agents for comprehensive security review
Receive trust scores across 4 dimensions (Security, Transparency, Reliability, Compliance)
Get listed in the public Guardian AI Registry
Earn the Guardian AI Certified badge
Increase user adoption (certified agents see 3x higher adoption)
For Users:

Search certified AI agents before trusting them
