CREATE A NEW PAGE ON nashpaintpros.io USING THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. THIS PAGE MUST BE TITLED:

"Why Your $40K Website Is Holding You Back"

THE PAGE MUST CLEARLY EXPLAIN WHY THE CURRENT $40,000/YEAR STATIC SITE (A BASIC SQUARESPACE‑STYLE BUILD WITH NO FUNCTIONALITY) IS OUTDATED, OVERPRICED, AND UNDERPERFORMING — AND WHY THE NEW AI‑DRIVEN SITE WE BUILT IS ALREADY OUTPERFORMING IT IN ONLY THREE WEEKS.

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CONTENT EXACTLY AND STRUCTURE IT CLEANLY WITH HEADERS, SUBHEADERS, AND BULLET POINTS:

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — COST VS. VALUE

• Current website cost: **$40,000 per year**
• Platform type: Basic static site with minimal functionality
• Missing features: No AI tools, no automation, no analytics intelligence, no dynamic SEO, no lead funnels, no campaign systems, no local targeting, no performance optimization

State clearly: “You are paying enterprise‑level pricing for a website that performs like a $20/month template.”

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (OLD SITE VS. NEW SITE)

Use this table:

| Metric                        | Old Site (90 Days)             | New Site (3 Weeks)              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Homepage Sessions            | 1,058                          | 1,176                           |
| Top Subpage Sessions         | /contact/ — 285                | /api/blockchain/stats — 2,171  |
| Unique IPs                   | Not listed                     | 5,569                           |
| Referrer Traffic             | Not listed                     | google.com — 1,492; yahoo.com — 726 |
| Engagement Rate              | 92–100%                        | High request volume, strong interest |
| SEO Targeting                | Generic, non‑local             | AI‑driven, local SEO ready      |

Add a callout box:

“**The new site matched or exceeded the old site’s 90‑day traffic in under 21 days.**”

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — WHY THE NEW SITE WINS

Explain that the new site is:

• AI‑powered  
• SEO‑adaptive  
• Built for local dominance  
• Integrated with analytics and behavior tracking  
• Designed for high‑intent lead capture  
• Capable of automated content generation  
• Faster, lighter, and more discoverable  
• Built to scale with campaigns, ads, and seasonal pushes  

Include:  
“This is not a website. It is a marketing engine.”

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — LOCAL SEO ADVANTAGE

Explain that the old site has:

• No geo‑targeted content  
• No keyword clusters  
• No service‑area landing pages  
• No structured data  
• No automated SEO tuning  

Explain that the new site is built to:

• Target every city, suburb, and neighborhood in Middle Tennessee  
• Rank for residential and commercial painting keywords  
• Capture high‑intent traffic  
• Expand automatically as new content is added  

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — FINANCIAL ARGUMENT

Include this exact statement:

“You are paying $40,000 per year for a static brochure site. Our AI‑driven platform outperforms it at a fraction of the cost — and generates measurable traffic growth, lead flow, and long‑term SEO value.”

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — CALL TO ACTION

Add a final CTA section:

“Ready to stop paying for a website that doesn’t perform?  
Let’s switch to a platform that actually grows your business.”

Include a button: **Schedule a Strategy Call**
------------------------------------------------------------

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

• Clean, modern, geometric layout  
• Professional tone  
• High‑contrast headers  
• Clear data visualization (tables or simple charts)  
• No fluff — strictly business value  
• Mobile‑optimized  
• Fast‑loading
